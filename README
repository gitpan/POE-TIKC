NAME
    POE::TIKC - Transparent Inter-Kernel Communication (IKC)

SYNOPSIS
            use POE qw(TIKC);

            POE::TIKC->create_server({
                    address => '127.0.0.1', # default
                    port => '2021',                 # default
            });

    # You can now assume all connected clients' aliases are available #
    AFTER...you check if $POE::TIKC::connected == 1 before starting.

DESCRIPTION
    This module connects many clients to one server and creates proxy
    sessions in the client and the server for all aliases. When you post to
    a proxied session, it is sent to the right client and reposted there.

BUGS
    Probably, its not fully tested. So use this at your own risk of life and
    data.

FEATURES
    You can't post globs

    You can't use session ids

    You must check $POE::TIKC::connected == 1 before posting events until I
    can fix this by queueing the posts until a connection is made

    You must make sure Storable is the same version on all machines using
    TIKC

    Using $_[SENDER] for anything would be bad

    Using call() instead of post will not return usefull info from the
    remote kernel
